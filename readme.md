Spring MVC C.R.U.D. project

This project was done by Yvette Menase. I completed this project at the end of week seven
at Skill Distillery. It showcases the features of a basic CRUD (Create, Read,
  Update, Delete) application.

Premise

This application allows a user to view famous paintings and add a painting as
well. The painting attributes include title, artist, price, note, and image.

How it Works
A user can add a painting or delete it by using the respective buttons.


Technologies Used

Java
HTML
CSS
Tomcat 8
JSP/JSTL

Future Project Updates
I could add filtering. I also need to add a navigation bar.
